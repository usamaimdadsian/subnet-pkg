Description: # Subnet
        
        The Subnet is a python library that can subnet an IP address for different networks. A user can set the static or dynamic mode for subnetting. Currently, this library only supports IPv4 addresses.
        
        ## Installation
        
        Use the package manager [pip](https://pip.pypa.io/en/stable/) to install the subnet.
        
        ```bash
        pip install subnet
        ```
        
        ## Usage
        
        ```python
        import subnet as sb
        
        IP = "192.168.1.12/24"
        ```
        To subnet this data for 3 networks (1,2,3) which have 10,3 and 0 hosts then the data variable would be in the following form.
        ```python
        data = {1:10,2:3,3:0}
        ```
        This library automatically assigns the IP address for the network and broadcast even if the host's value is 0.
        ### Static Subnetting
        ```python
        a = sb.Subnet(IP,data,static=True)
        a.summary()
        ```
        ### Dynamic Subnetting
        ```python
        a = sb.Subnet(IP,data)
        a.summary()
        ```
